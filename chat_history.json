You want a React Native mobile app using Expo 54, a color-based memory game called \"Color Memory Cascade\". It should feature infinite levels that increase in difficulty, and the player should be able to continue playing even if they make mistakes. There's no losing, just continuous gameplay.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** A simple screen with a \"Start Game\" button.\n*   **Game Screen:** This is where the core gameplay happens. It will display a sequence of colors that the player needs to memorize and repeat.\n*   **Level Progression:** Implement a system where the game increases in difficulty as the player successfully completes levels (e.g., by increasing the number of colors in the sequence, decreasing the time to memorize the sequence, or introducing more similar colors).\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f4f7` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#2d3436` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#747d8c` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#007bff` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#6c757d` (Gray)\n    *   Accent: `#ffc107` (Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#28a745` (Green)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for React Native) for readability.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these features.\n\n**Plan for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is a React Native app using Expo 54.\n2.  **Home Screen:** Create a basic home screen with a \"Start Game\" button that navigates to the game screen.\n3.  **Game Screen:**\n    *   Implement the core game logic:\n        *   Generate a random sequence of colors.\n        *   Display the sequence to the player for a short duration.\n        *   Allow the player to input the sequence.\n        *   Check if the player's input is correct.\n        *   If correct, proceed to the next level with increased difficulty.\n        *   If incorrect, allow the player to try again without losing the game.\n    *   Implement the color display and input mechanism (e.g., using buttons or touchable elements).\n4.  **Level Progression:** Implement the logic to increase the difficulty of the game as the player progresses through levels. This could involve increasing the length of the color sequence, decreasing the display time, or using more similar colors.\n5.  **Navigation:** Set up navigation between the home screen and the game screen.\n6.  **Styling:** Apply the specified colors and typography to the app's components.\n\nFinally, remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-21T16:29:37.119989"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a Color Memory Cascade game!
